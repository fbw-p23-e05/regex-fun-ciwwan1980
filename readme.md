    
    ? (Question Mark):

        ? means "zero or one time."
        It allows the preceding element to occur either zero times or exactly one time.
        Example: colou?r matches "color" or "colour," but not "colouur."


    * (Asterisk):

        * means "zero or more times."
        It allows the preceding element to occur zero times or more times.
        Example: ca*t matches "ct," "cat," "caat," "caaat," etc.


    . (Dot):

        Matches any single character (except for \n).
        It can be thought of as a placeholder for any character.
        Example: c.t matches "cat," "cut," "c?t," and so on, as long as there's one character between 'c' and 't'.
